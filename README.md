Creating comprehensive documentation for your npm package and GitHub repository is essential for helping users understand how to use your library and contribute to it. Below are the steps and examples for documenting your npm package and GitHub repository.

### Documentation for npm Package

#### 1. `README.md` for GitHub and npm

Create a `README.md` file in the root directory of your npm package. This file will serve as the main documentation for both GitHub and npm.

```markdown
# Preact Lazy Load

`preact-lazy-load` is a lightweight library for implementing lazy loading in Preact applications. It includes components for lazy loading images, iframes, and background images, with fallback support for older browsers.

## Installation

You can install the library via npm:

```sh
npm install preact-lazy-load
```

## Usage

Here’s how to use the components in your Preact application:

### LazyImage

A component for lazy loading images.

```jsx
import { h } from 'preact';
import { LazyImage } from 'preact-lazy-load';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <LazyImage
    src="path/to/image.jpg"
    srcset="path/to/image-320w.jpg 320w, path/to/image-480w.jpg 480w"
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 320px, 480px"
    alt="Description of image"
  />
);
```

### LazyIframe

A component for lazy loading iframes.

```jsx
import { h } from 'preact';
import { LazyIframe } from 'preact-lazy-load';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <LazyIframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    title="Sample Video"
  />
);
```

### LazyBackgroundImage

A component for lazy loading background images.

```jsx
import { h } from 'preact';
import { LazyBackgroundImage } from 'preact-lazy-load';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <LazyBackgroundImage src="path/to/background-image.jpg">
    <p>Content overlaying the background image</p>
  </LazyBackgroundImage>
);
```

## Development

To build the library:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push to the branch.
5. Create a pull request.

## License

MIT License. See `LICENSE` for more information.
```

#### 2. `package.json` Scripts and Metadata

Ensure your `package.json` includes relevant metadata for npm. This is crucial for npm’s package registry and for users who install your package.

```json
{
  "name": "preact-lazy-load",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A library for lazy loading images, iframes, and background images in Preact applications.",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "preact",
    "lazy-loading",
    "images",
    "iframe",
    "background-image"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "preact": "^10.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "preact": "^10.0.0",
    "rollup": "^2.0.0",
    "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve": "^13.0.0",

    "@rollup/plugin-terser": "^7.0.0",
    "babel-preset-react": "^7.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Documentation for GitHub Repository

#### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Create a repository on GitHub:** Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository.
2. **Push your code to GitHub:**
    ```sh
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/preact-lazy-load.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

#### 2. GitHub Repository Structure

Ensure your GitHub repository has the following structure:

```
preact-lazy-load/
├── dist/                   # Bundled output directory
├── src/                    # Source code directory
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── LazyImage.js
│   ├── LazyIframe.js
│   └── LazyBackgroundImage.js
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE                 # License file
├── README.md               # Documentation file
├── package.json            # npm package metadata
└── rollup.config.js        # Rollup configuration
```

#### 3. Adding a License

Create a `LICENSE` file to specify the license under which your code is distributed. For example, for the MIT License:

```plaintext
